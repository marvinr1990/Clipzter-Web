# Clipzter Web

Clipzter Web is a lightweight, web-based clipboard manager built with React and TypeScript. It allows you to easily save, manage, and retrieve text snippets directly in your browser.

## Features

*   **Save Snippets:** Quickly add new text entries with an optional title.
*   **Copy & Paste:** One-click copy functionality to retrieve your saved text.
*   **Search:** Filter your saved entries by title to find what you need fast.
*   **Dark Mode:** Toggle between Light and Dark themes for comfortable viewing.
*   **Persistence:** Your data is saved locally in your browser (LocalStorage), so it survives page reloads.
